We contribute here a Matlab Graphical User Interface (GUI) for predicting the axial capacity of elliptical concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns based on a pretrained machine-learning model.
The machine learning model was developed based on a hybrid combination between Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA).

After selecting the value of input variables, the axial capacity of CFST columns is displayed directly by clicking the Start Predict button.
